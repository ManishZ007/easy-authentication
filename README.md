**Overview**

This project provides a fully customizable authentication solution using NextAuth, designed to be open-source and reusable. Whether you're building a personal project or a large-scale application, this repository allows you to implement authentication effortlessly so that you can focus on your primary project goals.

**Objective**

The main objective of this project is to offer a plug-and-play authentication system that developers can easily integrate into their Next.js applications. With full customization options, users can tailor the authentication flow to suit their specific needs. By utilizing this solution, developers can bypass the complexities of building an authentication system from scratch and instead concentrate on the core aspects of their application.
